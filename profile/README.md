# 🚀 Welcome to M21.chat: The Everywhere AI 🚀
Hey there, digital wanderer! 🌐✨

You've just stumbled upon the most ambitious, privacy-focused, and quirky AI project on this side of the galaxy: M21.chat. Imagine having a chat with an AI buddy that doesn't judge, doesn't track, and is available faster than you can say "privacy" - no matter where in the world (or off it) you might be!

## Why M21.chat? 🤔💡
In a world where big tech is always watching 👀, we're building a cosy corner of the internet where you can interact with AI without the creepy feeling of being tracked. Our mission is as bold as it is simple:

- Privacy First: Your secrets are safe with us because we don't store them. Period.
- Accessibility Overload: Whether you're sending a smoke signal or tapping into the matrix via Telnet, SSH, LORAWAN, CW, or any tech you've rigged up in your backyard, we're on it.
- Ad-Free Existence: Enjoy uninterrupted conversations without pesky ads. Your peace of mind is not for sale.
= Emergency Encyclopedia: Stuck in a pickle? M21.chat is your go-to AI for those "How do I fix this?" moments.

## Join the Revolution! 🌟🙌
But here's the twist - maintaining an AI sanctuary free from the clutches of big tech and making it accessible via every communication tool known to humanity is as challenging as teaching a robot to love. That's where you come in!
We are looking for anyone that want to integrate with us in the most obscure protocol possible. The weirder is better. Share your build of a quantum entanglement communication protocol and we will integrate.

### Planned communication mediums
- [ ] Telnet/SSH multi-user App
- [ ] LoRAWan
- [ ] Web app
- [ ] SMS
- [ ] Voice call (GSM)
- [ ] Telegram
- [ ] Dialup modem
